# USCIS-Case-Status-Auto-Check
The syntax can automatically pull 100 case status before and after your query case by case type (I539 change of status or I765 EAD card). Since the case number in USCIS system is sequentically generated by its receiving time, the results will help estimate when the query case can expect a status update.
